                College and That First Job: Designing and Evaluating Policies for Hiring Diversity [Job Market Paper]</a></li><br>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> In India's urban labor markets, disadvantaged castes earn 15% less than
comparable advantaged castes in India's urban labor markets, with the largest
disparities concentrated in the private sector. Such disparities remain
pronounced despite widespread and effective affirmative action policies in
college admissions. Moreover, there is no empirical evidence evaluating
compensatory hiring practices for disadvantaged castes. This paper studies
policies to promote caste diversity in hiring. To do so, I employ novel data
on every stage of the job placement process of an elite technical college in
India, half of which is comprised of students from disadvantaged castes. The
administrative data includes rich student-level information on all stages of
job search, including job applications, pre-interview screening tests, job
interviews, job offers, and job choices. I offer the first quantitative
decomposition of the earnings drop off across castes at each stage of the job
placement process. I show that the compositions of job applications and job
choices do not explain the earnings gap. Furthermore, I show that almost all
of the earnings drop off occurs between job interviews and job offers. These
findings suggest that policies which provide information about jobs, modify
preferences, or improve performance at university are unlikely to close the
earnings gap. Guided by the sequential decomposition of the earnings gap, I
build a model of the job placement process. The model, which incorporates both
the supply of and demand for jobs, is estimated using the method of simulated
likelihood. My estimates show that caste disparities in hiring are not driven
by differential caste-affinity over job characteristics but by hiring
decisions of firms. Finally, I evaluate policies to promote hiring diversity.
First, I consider a subsidy in which firms are compensated by the amount that
makes them indifferent between hiring, observably identical, advantaged or
disadvantaged castes. Second, I consider a "pre-college intervention" policy
which equalizes the distribution of pre-college test scores across castes. To
compare cost-effectiveness, I use the model estimates and calculate the change
in test scores required to induce the same effects as those under direct
subsidies. The change in test scores is large because the model estimates
imply that test scores play extremely modest roles in hiring. Even under
extremely conservative assumptions, a back of the envelope calculation based
on cost estimates of improving student test scores in India shows that direct
subsidies can be twice as cost-effective as the ``pre-college intervention"
policy.

                Finish Last? Socio-Emotional Skills, Academic Performance, Job Search, and Placements at a Top U.S.
                Business School</a>, with John Eric Humphries. </li><br>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> This paper studies how socio-emotional skills affect academic outcomes and eventual job placements among MBA students at a top U.S. business school. We employ novel data comprising detailed personality measures allowing for rich patterns of sorting based on multidimensional traits. These personality measures, such as compassion, gregariousness, assertiveness etc., are assessed through forced-choice methods which provide robust safeguards against “gaming”. Next, we perform a descriptive analysis of the role of socio-emotional skills in explaining academic performance and sorting patterns in job applications, interview selection and job choices. Finally, we estimate a sequential model of the key stages of the MBA program, including academic performance, course specialization, job search and job placements. Through this model, we focus on quantifying the salience of socio-emotional skills in the business school experience. The model is of general interest and can serve as a prototype for business schools and other institutions interested in understanding the role of socio-emotional abilities in explaining academic performance and labor market outcomes.

                and Investment in Developing Countries</a>, with Rafael Dix-Carneiro, Costas Meghir and Jean-Marc Robin.
            </li><br>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> What labor market policies improve wages, allocations and welfare in the presence of a large informal
                sector? We answer this question in Brazil --- a country in which nearly half of the workforce is employed in the
                informal sector. To do so, we develop an equilibrium wage-posting model with workers who search randomly on and off
                the job. Firms are heterogeneous in total-factor productivity and choose their sector of location (formal or
                informal), wages and capital investments. The rental rate of capital may differ across sectors. Firms are monopolistic
                competitors in the goods market and monopsonistic competitors in the labor market, as they set both prices and wages.
                Market power arises from preference for diversity in the goods market and from search frictions in the labor market.
                Moreover, preferences are non-homothetic, so market demand depends on the entire distribution of income. We estimate
                the model using data on formal firms (Relação Anual de Informações Sociais -- RAIS), informal firms (Economia
                Informal Urbana -- ECINF), and formal and informal workers (Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego -- PME). In counterfactual
                simulations, we quantify the equilibrium effects on wages, allocations, and welfare of (a) increasing the cost of informality,
                (b) equalizing the rental rate of capital across sectors, and (c) increasing aggregate productivity, so that the economy is
                richer and demands lesser informal sector goods.

                generating a suite of nonlinear inequalities for the iteration sequence, and we show that the sequence has a natural energy
                that decreases along the sequence.
