                        What drives socioeconomic disparities in elite job access, and where do these inequalities emerge? 
                        Measuring class discrimination is challenging, as status must often be inferred from subtle markers like accent, 
                        education, or networks. India's caste system provides an explicit social class measure, enabling precise 
                        identification of how status affects elite job access. Analyzing detailed screening data from over 1,000 jobs at 
                        primarily U.S. and European multinationals hiring in India, this paper provides the first systematic quantification 
                        of class bias in elite recruitment, identifying both its sources and mechanisms. Personal interviews assessing candidate 
                        "fit" drive nearly 90% of the caste earnings penalty (0.16 standard deviations). However, disadvantaged caste hires 
                        achieve 20% higher promotion rates, suggesting these disparities cannot be justified by ability differences. To formally 
                        distinguish discrimination from unobserved ability differences, I develop a theoretical framework utilizing plausibly 
                        exogenous variation in screening selectivity across jobs. The framework predicts that, absent discrimination, the promotion 
                        advantage of disadvantaged caste hires should shrink in highly selective jobs. Instead, persistently higher and stable 
                        promotion rates of disadvantaged hires across all selectivity tiers are most consistent with discrimination. These patterns 
                        persist across both client-facing and non-client-facing roles, suggesting bias rather than statistical or customer-driven 
                        motives. My findings reveal how subjective "fit" assessments can undermine both diversity and efficient talent allocation 
                        in elite hiring.

                    Interviews allow employers to learn about workers, but do they also enable workers to learn about firms? Studying 500,000 interview reports from Glassdoor, we find candidates for high-paying jobs are more likely to reject a job offer if they believe the interview was easy. Easy interviews appear to convey poor "fit" as those who accept offers after easy interviews are two-fifths of a standard deviation less satisfied with their jobs and 10 percent less likely to remain with their employer for at least one year. Analysis of interview narratives using large language models reveals difficult interviews signal colleague ability whereas easy interviews convey a nonselective process. In a small-scale randomized field experiment, an exogenous increase in difficulty elevated perceived difficulty and boosted applicant engagement with the vacancy. Interviews offer workers a preview of match quality, highlighting a channel through which labor markets may become less efficient if firms automate hiring with AI.
